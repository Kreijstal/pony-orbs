This start orb is based on a character of My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic; It's Twilight Sparckle cutie mark, one of the main characters.
This one was made from  scratch as the others fucked up in massive levels. (Als o, it was edited quite a lot, I had to make like 4 versions of explorer.exe because of various reasons, like transparency without dmw (aero), was quite hard to make it work...)
There are PSD files if you want to edit something....  (made in photoshop CS6)
WARNING/ACHTUNG: The explorer.exe attached here is (64bit) for windows ultimate (my version of windows), I don't know if it could actually just work if you replace it.. (On mine it would.) So if you're lazy, and you got windows 7 64 bit, it might work. if it doesn't.. don'lt panic, just use your original explorer.exe
You will find attached a transparent background .PNG, I did this for whichever reason might be helpful, since PNG format is much more puplar than microsoft .BMP. So yeah..
Yeah, you can pretty much edit everything, enjoy it.


Also, the cutie mark, in Photoshop you will see it as a smart object, but for editing you will need Illustrator... (or Corel Draw (I don't know if inkscape can do .ai files.))
I vectorized the cutie mark from a screencap taken with GOM player from a mkv (iTunes episode) of the first episode of the first season of My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic. 
I really hope you like it.
